# Example App for Modular State Updates (MSU) in React

This is just a small example react app

The main idea here is that state update functions are kept in a separate file for clarity (hopefully). The benefits are readability, and handeling state updates asynchronously as per [this link](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#using-state-correctly).

To see the example in action,
please have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Once you can verify that node is installed,
run the following commands:

```text
npm install
npm start
```

then open your browser at [localhost:8080](localhost:8080)
